### notes
I still struggling to setup ingress-nginx on kubernetes. somehow, when i hit host ingress it will return 404 resources not found. For convenience i suggest to run this rest-api with docker container, you can pull the image in haritsrizkal/crud-user:0.0.3 . Please ask me if you found any trouble.
